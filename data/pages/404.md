There are a couple of things that might have gone wrong, in order, from _"yes, that's definitely what happened"_, to _"in what kind of referenceable universe would that be possible"_:

1. **Very likely**. I fell asleep on top of the keyboard at some point and messed up.

2. **Possible**. My imaginary dog stole my content and posted it on his own blog.

3. **I doubt it**. You were actually looking for my 404 page, expecting to find a funny image, gif, joke, reference or clever wording.

4. **Have never happened before, therefore it won't happen again**. I moved the content to a different URL and forgot to add a redirect here ([please let me know!](#)).

5. **You're smart enough not to do that, so you of course did not**. You mistyped the URL (But at this point, why bother checking?).

## In any case, the _thing_ is not here. 

Maybe it was here and it's not anymore, maybe it was never here on the first place, maybe it will be here (don't bet on it). You can go back, or just [look at my other writings](/blog).

Most likely, my imaginary dog stole it (for likes, retweets or breakfast).
