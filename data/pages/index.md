Hello there! 

My name is Mathias (with a mute "h"), and I'm a Computer Science student from _Universidad Simón Bolívar_, with only a few months left to get my degree. I'm currently ~~living~~ surviving in Venezuela, while I work remotely as a Full Stack Developer. I intend to leave the country after I graduate, but I haven't made up my mind about where to go yet.

From the start of my CS studies at USB, I've always picked the courses that most interested me, when given the chance: Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages and especially Databases Design and Architecture. The rest of my time on the CS world, I've 

+ **Participated in coding competitions** such as ACM-ICPC and IOI,

+ **Worked remotely** for clients in different countries and timezones,

+ **Given classes** to newcomers to Computer Science and Programming,

+ **Led teams** of 8+ members for Software Development, and

+ **Developed tools** to make some programming tasks easier. 

I like to spend time away from code, so I watch movies, enjoy anime series and write stories from time to time.
