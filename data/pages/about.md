Hello there! 

My name is Mathias (with a mute "h"), and I'm a Computer Science student from _Universidad Simón Bolívar_, with only a few months left to get my degree. I'm currently ~~living~~ surviving in Venezuela, but soon to be relocating to Europe (if all goes well).

From the start of my CS studies at USB, I've always picked the courses that most interested me, when given the chance: Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages and especially Databases Design and Architecture. The rest of my time on the CS world, I've 

+ **Participated in coding competitions** such as ACM-ICPC and IOI,

+ **Worked remotely** for clients in different countries and timezones,

+ **Developed tools** to make some programming tasks easier. 

+ **Given classes** to newcomers to Computer Science and Programming,

+ **Led teams** of 8+ members for Software Development, and

I like to spend time away from code, so I watch movies, enjoy anime series and write stories from time to time.
