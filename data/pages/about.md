Hello there! 

My name is Mathias (with a mute "h"), and I'm a Software Developer Engineer, graduated from _Universidad Simón Bolívar_ with a Computer Science degree on July 2019. I'm currently ~~living~~ surviving in Venezuela, but will soon relocate to Europe, if all goes well!

From the start of my CS studies at USB, I've always picked the courses that most interested me, when I was given the chance: Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages and especially Databases Design and Architecture. The rest of my time on the CS world, I've 

+ **Participated in coding competitions** such as ACM-ICPC and IOI,

+ **Worked remotely** for people in different countries and time zones,

+ **Developed automation tools** to make some programming tasks easier,

+ **Worked as a SysAdmin** in a team responsible for the University's network,

+ **Given classes** to newcomers to Computer Science and Programming, and

+ **Led teams** of 8+ members for Software Development.

I like to spend time away from code, so I watch movies, enjoy anime series and write stories from time to time. As you can see, I like stories and all forms of storytelling.

I also speak Spanish, as it's my mother tongue! I might have a few Spanish writings here and there on the site.
